## Streaming stats

During the stream you can show debug statistics that contain extra data about the buffer queues and other information. To bring this up you can press `~` on your keyboard.

At the bottom-left you can see the status (although not always accurate). At the top-right you can find the FPS of the video and audio decoders including the latency. At the bottom-right you can find debug information about the buffer queues and other information that is useful for debugging perposes.

When possible always provide this information with your issue, if it is related.

The application also provides a way to see which of your friends are online. This can be useful when you want to quickly check if anyone is online to play with :)
